## Lucy: The Project Management Tool That Gets Out of Your Way.

In software, the most important work happens in the code. It happens in the design docs, the pull requests, and the focused "in-flow" state of a developer solving a hard problem.

So why do most project management tools pull you away from that work?

We’ve all been there: stuck in a tool that feels like it was designed for a different industry. A world of rigid Gantt charts, endless status meetings, and a frustrating disconnect between the "plan" and the reality of the development cycle. These tools create friction, add overhead, and force engineering teams to work against their natural rhythm.

We knew there had to be a better way.

### Our Story

Spokesoft was born from decades of experience building and leading software teams. Our founder, `jtrumbull`, saw the same pattern play out in company after company: talented engineers were being bogged down by administrative overhead, and the tools meant to provide clarity were only creating more noise.

The problem was clear: project management software was built for managers, not for makers.

We started Spokesoft to fix this. We envisioned a tool that was fast, intuitive, and deeply integrated with the way modern software teams actually work. We dreamed of a tool that automates tedious updates, clarifies priorities without a meeting, and connects the conversation directly to the codebase.

That tool is **Lucy**.

### Our Mission: Connect the Spokes, Build with Momentum

A great software team is like a wheel. Every person—from product and design to frontend and backend—is a critical spoke. When every spoke is aligned and connected to a central hub, the wheel is strong, balanced, and can move with incredible speed.

Our mission at Spokesoft is to be that hub.

Our product, Lucy, is designed to connect all the moving parts of your development process. We're not here to add more process; we're here to streamline it. Lucy helps you manage sprints, crush technical debt, and communicate with your team, all while staying closer to your code.

We believe that when you reduce friction, you unleash potential. When you give builders the right tools, they don't just ship features—they create value, solve problems, and push the world forward.

That's the future we're building at Spokesoft.
