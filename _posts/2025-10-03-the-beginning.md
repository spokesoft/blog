**Every** great journey starts with a single step. This is ours.

Welcome to the Spokesoft blog. We're the team behind **Lucy**, and we're on a mission to build a project management tool that actually works the way software teams do—fast, integrated, and without the friction.

But we're not just building a product. We're building a company, and we've decided to do it in public.

### What does "building in public" mean?

It means we're pulling back the curtain. Right here on this blog, we'll be sharing our journey with you—the wins, the challenges, the late-night bug fixes, and the "aha!" moments. We'll talk about the features we're building for Lucy, the technical hurdles we're overcoming, and the lessons we're learning along the way.

Why? Because we believe in transparency. We believe that the best products are built with the community, not just for them. We want to share what we know, learn from your feedback, and create a conversation around building better software.

This is more than just a product announcement. It's an invitation.

Follow along as we build Lucy from the ground up. We're excited to have you on this journey with us.

Let's get started.
